# psa hates me

## internet checks?
for nerds, you know what you're doing, you shouldn't blow up your car (or do other illegal stuff, just don't have skill issue with diesels?)

# PSA Patcher
This thing will remove the internet checks out of all "playbooks" provided with a DiagBox compatible collection of "playbooks". \
This would theoretically allow you to access menus in DiagBox normally locked behind an internet connection, but will not make anything possible that requires data from PSA servers (duh). \
Please use responsibly in consideration of your own personal safety and that of others that may be so unfortunate to end up behind/in front of you on the highway or any other street.

It will also produce a file called `_psaPatcher.json` which you could use to revert all patches (didn't write a program for that yet) so you don't have to reinstall DiagBox if this breaks your install.
